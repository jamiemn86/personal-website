          For the final module of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp I did in
          2021, I had to build a SPA using React. The project requirements were
          as follows:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>1. Build both a client and a server app</li>
          <li>
            2. The project needed to use React. Typescript was not allowed
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Regarding the server app, it needed to have authentication
            features including sign up, sign in and log out. It needed at least
            2 modules, including the User module. A final requirement was that
            the server app needed to perform all CRUD operations on a model that
            was not the User one
          </li>
          <li>
            4. The app needed to be linked to a GitHub repo and an MVP had to be
            deployed on Heroku and Netlify within 1 week. In total, we had 2
            weeks to complete the project
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

          . The idea came from AmÃ©lie, and was based on her voluntary experience
          helping frogs cross a village road every year in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. We
          called the site "Real Frogger". At its core, it was a CRUD app where
          users could log in, update the number of frogs they had caught, and
          then see a summary of the combined user data.{' '}
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mt-6">
          My responsibility for the project was the authentication as well as
          the Admin messaging system, where a super user had the ability to send
          messages to all the volunteers which were then displayed on a
          notifications board. I ran into plenty of issues with the
          authentication, in particular one tricky CORS issue. With regards to
          the messaging system, I learned the hard way that if you make changes
          to the back end, always restart your local server ðŸ˜‚ All in all, it
          was a fun project and I learned a lot from both AmÃ©lie and Gregor. Our
          project was voted as the most interesting by our graduating class, and
          we were picked to present it to Ironhack's other graduating classes a
          few weeks later.
