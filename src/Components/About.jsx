          I was born in Belgium and grew up outside of Brussels, in a small town
          pictured above. However, I have British and Danish passports, as my
          family is not Belgian. I studied in the UK and then worked in both
          London and Berlin. At the end of 2021, I moved to Gda≈Ñsk, Poland,
          where I am currently working.

          I had been interested in doing a web development course for a long
          time, as I had previously worked with developers and on web projects
          in a QA and Project Management capacity. However it was only in
          February 2021 that I became serious about learning more and decided to
          begin a remote Frontend Web Development course. This 10 week course
          made me curious to learn more, and in June of 2021 I enrolled in a 6
          month part-time Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, graduating in
          November. The last module of this Bootcamp focused on React and
          building SPAs. React has since been a library that I have been trying
          to learn as much as possible about, mainly by completing Udemy
          Courses.
